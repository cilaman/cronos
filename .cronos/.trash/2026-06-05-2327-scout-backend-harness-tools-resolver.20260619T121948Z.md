# Brief

CC-v1 scout phase for sub-goal: Backend harness tools resolver.

## Feature request (full scope this slice must deliver)
Implement the harness runtime tools-resolver so agent and skill nodes resolve to a
real `AiToolEntry`, and briefs are composed with the correct agent header / skill prefix.

Acceptance criteria:
1. **Real resolver.** Replace the stub `_tools_resolver` at `backend/app/worker.py:470-471`
   (signature `(space_id: str, agent_ref: str) -> AiToolEntry | None`) with a real implementation.
   REUSE the existing scanners — do not re-implement scanning: `_scan_category` and `_scan_skills`
   in `backend/app/tools/scanner.py`, and `_scan_context` in `backend/app/api/tools.py`. Resolve by
   matching `agent_ref` against agent, skill, command and context entries, searching the space-scoped
   `.claude` directory and the global scope. Return `None` on no match.
2. **Wiring.** The resolver is already passed into `HarnessExecutor` and called at
   `backend/app/harnesses/executor.py:753`; confirm the resolved `agent_entry` flows into
   `compose_brief` so the agent header is added.
3. **Skill prefix.** When `agent_ref` resolves to a skill (path under `.claude/skills/`), the resolved
   entry must let `brief_composer._is_skill` detect it so the brief is prefixed with `/<skill-name>`
   (see `backend/app/harnesses/brief_composer.py`). Verify agent vs skill vs plain-ref behaviour.
4. **Tests.** Add pytest covering: agent match, skill match (asserts `/` prefix in composed brief),
   command/context match, miss → `None`, and space-vs-global scoping. Keep the 60% coverage floor:
   `cd backend && pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing`.

Backend-only changes under `backend/app/`. Do not modify the harness Pydantic models.

## Scope (files this slice is allowed to touch)
backend/app/worker.py (the _tools_resolver function only), reusing backend/app/tools/scanner.py and backend/app/api/tools.py scanners; backend/app/harnesses/brief_composer.py (read-only reference); new backend/tests/ files

## Phase instructions
- Agent contract: `.claude/agents/pipeline-scout.md` (class=research).
- Read the prior phase artifact(s) in `.cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/`.
- Scout report: `.cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/scout-report-backend-harness-tools-resolver.md`.
- Emit your artifact (class=research) into `.cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/`.
- The impl phase fans out one iteration at a time per the design's iterations[]; run /goal-branch-setup before the first code edit and /goal-task-commit after each.

Then run: /pipeline-gate

# History

```

I'll start by checking the working directory and reading any existing phase artifacts for context.

Now I'll do the reconnaissance by reading the key source files to understand the implementation requirements.

Now I'll create the scout report documenting my findings and design for the implementation.

Now I'll close the scout phase by running the pipeline-gate.

I'll now execute the pipeline-gate steps to verify the scout report and gate the next phase.

Gate PASS — scout / backend-harness-tools-resolver
  artifact: .cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/scout-report-backend-harness-tools-resolver.md

STATUS: DONE
```
