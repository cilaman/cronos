# Brief

CC-v1 test phase for sub-goal: Frontend harness editor.

## Feature request (full scope this slice must deliver)
Align the harness visual editor to the backend data model so saved harnesses
are valid and runnable. The backend model in `backend/app/harnesses/model.py` is the source of
truth and MUST NOT be changed.

Acceptance criteria:
1. **Node data round-trip.** `frontend/src/components/harness/harnessMapping.ts` `toReactFlow()`
   maps backend `node.data` into the editor and `fromReactFlow()` maps editor state back into
   `node.data` (NOT a separate `config` key). No keys are dropped in either direction. Update
   `frontend/src/types.ts` so the node type exposes `data` consistently.
2. **prompt_template.** The agent prompt field persists to `node.data.prompt_template` (what the
   runtime reads at `backend/app/harnesses/executor.py:736`). `VariableInspector.tsx` currently
   reads/writes `config.prompt` — fix it.
3. **ports as dict + defaults + Handle ids.** `fromReactFlow()` emits `ports` as `dict[str,dict]`
   (never a list, never `[]`). New nodes get default ports matching the Handle `id`s their node
   component renders: DecisionNode (`yes`,`no`), AgentNode/TriggerNode/WaitNode (single in/out),
   AggregatorNode (N inputs + single out). A freshly dragged node must save without a 422.
4. **Edge condition round-trip + editing.** `HarnessEdge.condition: str|None` (backend) maps to/from
   the editor edge. Decision-out edges expose an editable condition (`yes`/`no`/default = null).
5. **Editable config for ALL node types**, not just Agent: decision condition, wait
   `max_wait_seconds` + mode, aggregator `mode` (all/any), trigger kind + per-kind fields.
6. **Variables add/edit/remove.** Wire `onVariableChange` through `HarnessEditor.tsx` so it mutates
   `harness.variables`; add UI to add and remove variable rows. Saved harness has the variables.
7. **Save feedback.** Surface backend 422 validation errors in the editor (inline or toast) instead
   of failing silently.

All changes are frontend-only under `frontend/src/`. Add/extend vitest coverage for harnessMapping
round-trip and VariableInspector field wiring. Run `cd frontend && npm test` and `npm run build`.

## Scope (files this slice is allowed to touch)
frontend/src/types.ts, frontend/src/components/harness/harnessMapping.ts, frontend/src/components/harness/VariableInspector.tsx, frontend/src/pages/HarnessEditor.tsx, frontend/src/components/harness/{Agent,Trigger,Decision,Wait,Aggregator}Node.tsx, frontend/src/components/harness/NodePalette.tsx, and their vitest specs

## Phase instructions
- Agent contract: `.claude/agents/pipeline-tester.md` (class=test).
- Read the prior phase artifact(s) in `.cronos/pipeline/frontend-harness-editor/`.
- Scout report: `.cronos/pipeline/frontend-harness-editor/scout-report-frontend-harness-editor.md`.
- Emit your artifact (class=test) into `.cronos/pipeline/frontend-harness-editor/`.
- The impl phase fans out one iteration at a time per the design's iterations[]; run /goal-branch-setup before the first code edit and /goal-task-commit after each.

Then run: /pipeline-gate

I'll start by reading the pipeline artifacts and understanding what was implemented, then run the frontend tests.

Good. Now let me run the frontend tests to see the current state.

Build passes. Let me check the test results.

All 1109 tests pass across 68 test files. Build also succeeds. Let me check what test files specifically cover the scope of this implementation.

All tests pass. Now let me write the test report artifact.

Test report written. Now running `/pipeline-gate`.

The verifier found issues. Let me check the test phase schema to understand required fields.

I need to fix the test report — missing required header fields and sections. Let me rewrite it correctly.

Verify passes (exit 0). Now running Step 3 — state writer.

Both VERIFY_EXIT=0 and PY_EXIT=0. Gate passes.

gate PASS — test / frontend-harness-editor
  artifact: .cronos/pipeline/frontend-harness-editor/test-report-frontend-harness-editor.md

STATUS: DONE
```
