# Brief

CC-v1 doc phase for sub-goal: Backend harness tools resolver.

## Feature request (full scope this slice must deliver)
Implement the harness runtime tools-resolver so agent and skill nodes resolve to a
real `AiToolEntry`, and briefs are composed with the correct agent header / skill prefix.

Acceptance criteria:
1. **Real resolver.** Replace the stub `_tools_resolver` at `backend/app/worker.py:470-471`
   (signature `(space_id: str, agent_ref: str) -> AiToolEntry | None`) with a real implementation.
   REUSE the existing scanners — do not re-implement scanning: `_scan_category` and `_scan_skills`
   in `backend/app/tools/scanner.py`, and `_scan_context` in `backend/app/api/tools.py`. Resolve by
   matching `agent_ref` against agent, skill, command and context entries, searching the space-scoped
   `.claude` directory and the global scope. Return `None` on no match.
2. **Wiring.** The resolver is already passed into `HarnessExecutor` and called at
   `backend/app/harnesses/executor.py:753`; confirm the resolved `agent_entry` flows into
   `compose_brief` so the agent header is added.
3. **Skill prefix.** When `agent_ref` resolves to a skill (path under `.claude/skills/`), the resolved
   entry must let `brief_composer._is_skill` detect it so the brief is prefixed with `/<skill-name>`
   (see `backend/app/harnesses/brief_composer.py`). Verify agent vs skill vs plain-ref behaviour.
4. **Tests.** Add pytest covering: agent match, skill match (asserts `/` prefix in composed brief),
   command/context match, miss → `None`, and space-vs-global scoping. Keep the 60% coverage floor:
   `cd backend && pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing`.

Backend-only changes under `backend/app/`. Do not modify the harness Pydantic models.

## Scope (files this slice is allowed to touch)
backend/app/worker.py (the _tools_resolver function only), reusing backend/app/tools/scanner.py and backend/app/api/tools.py scanners; backend/app/harnesses/brief_composer.py (read-only reference); new backend/tests/ files

## Phase instructions
- Agent contract: `.claude/agents/pipeline-doc-sync.md` (class=doc).
- Read the prior phase artifact(s) in `.cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/`.
- Scout report: `.cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/scout-report-backend-harness-tools-resolver.md`.
- Emit your artifact (class=doc) into `.cronos/pipeline/backend-harness-tools-resolver/`.
- The impl phase fans out one iteration at a time per the design's iterations[]; run /goal-branch-setup before the first code edit and /goal-task-commit after each.

Then run: /pipeline-gate
